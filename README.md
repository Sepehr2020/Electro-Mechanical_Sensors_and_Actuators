Course Description: This course provides an introduction to sensors and actuators for electromechanical, computer-controlled machines and devices. Topics include operating principles, design considerations, and applications of analog sensors, digital transducers, stepper motors, continuous-drive actuators, and drive system electronics. Component integration and design considerations are studied through examples selected from applications of machine tools, mechatronics, precision machines, robotics, aerospace systems, and ground and underwater vehicles. Laboratory exercises strengthen the understanding of component performance, system design and integration.
